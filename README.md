# Digital Music Recording and Storage System using Authentication and Database Encryption

## Digital Music Recording and Storage system that allows users to register, login, record, storage and rate with security techniques by authentication and encyption of data within the database.

## Introduction:

This project addresses copyright infringement concerns in the music industry, focusing on preventing unauthorised copying of user recordings. The application employs robust authentication mechanisms, role-based access control, and encryption techniques to safeguard recordings. User authentication ensures that only registered users and admins can access the system, with admins having broader management capabilities. Role-based access control restricts regular users from viewing or managing other users' recordings, while admins can oversee all recordings. Encryption of filenames and passwords provides an additional layer of security, ensuring data remains protected even if the database is compromised. These measures collectively prevent unauthorised access and copying, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. By securing user data and controlling access, the application ensures that recordings remain accessible only to their rightful owners and authorised personnel.

## Secure Database:

To overcome the main issues associated with relying on passwords and to ensure authentication and authorisation, the method of two-factor authentication was developed. This approach involves using two distinct components, commonly referred to as factors, namely the login credentials such as the username and password as well as a One Time Password, a dynamic code that can be obtained by the user usually via SMS (Andrews, 2018). Thus, once the user logs into the system using their username and password, they are sent a One Time Password to authenticate them and authorise them access to their account. OTP operates on the principle that every user's account is connected to a mobile phone and ideally only the user should receive SMS messages sent to the phone number associated with their account (Mulliner et al., 2013). 
Therefore, as devices are physically owned by individuals and associated with a specific account, this makes OTP an integral component of a multi-factor authentication (Reese et al., 2019). However, as studies have highlighted there several criticisms of OTP. This includes an attacker acquiring the OTP through physical access to the phone, a SIM swap attack, or wireless interception (Mulliner et al., 2013). In all these instances a cybercriminal could gain access to the OTP and authorisation into the userâ€™s account. Thus, it is important to implement multiple layers of security measures as OTP can have limitations. 
This project uses PyOTP, a Python library for generating and authenticating one-time passwords. It is capable of implementing two-factor (2FA) or multi-factor (MFA) authentication methods in web applications and other systems that need users to log in. A time-based restriction element is also utilised to ensure the OTP times out if it is not used promptly. 


## Controlled Access:
Another Python library used in this project is the Password Validator. It is capable of validating passwords based on meting a set criteria. As described by Wang and Wang (2015), password composition policies are a set of guidelines that organisations use to help users create strong passwords. These policies outline the specifications for creating an acceptable password, including the minimum character length, for example, including at least eight characters, symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters). Password validation aims to address the issue of weak passwords and ensure users create stronger passwords. 
The purpose of strict password composition policies is to improve password security; however, they cannot guarantee that user-generated passwords will be difficult to crack. Users may still create passwords that meet the password composition policy requirements but are predictable, such as by using common words and dates or patterns (Guo et al., 2019). Therefore, to overcome these vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement multiple layers of security measures.

### Key Management:
Check if Key Exists:
This part checks if the encryption key file exists. If not, it generates a new key and saves it; otherwise, it loads the existing key.

### Database Setup:
Setup Database:
This function sets up the SQLite database with users and recordings tables.

 <span class="image fit"><img src="images/DBset.png" alt="" /></span>

### User Registration:
Register User:
This function registers a new user by prompting for a username and password, encrypting the password, and saving the details to the database.

<span class="image fit"><img src="images/reg.png" alt="" /></span>

Post Register Actions:
This function handles actions immediately after user registration, such as recording audio or logging out.
